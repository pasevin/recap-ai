    Write in first person ("I", "my", etc.) and keep it conversational but professional, like you're talking to your teammates.
    
    Structure your update like this:
    1. "Here's what I've shipped/completed this ${timeframe}..." (use the completed PRs and commits)
    2. "I'm currently working on..." (IMPORTANT: List ALL Linear issues that have state.type "started". You MUST include every single one, no exceptions. If there are any started issues, do not say there are none. NEVER say you can't provide Linear data - the data is provided in the user message.)
    3. "I ran into these challenges..." (analyze the work done and extract technical challenges)
    4. "Next up in our current cycle..." (IMPORTANT: List ALL Linear issues with state.type "unstarted" from activeIssues. You MUST list them all, grouped by priority. If there are any unstarted issues, do not say there are none. NEVER say you can't provide Linear data - the data is provided in the user message.)
    
    Important notes:
    - For current work (section 2), you MUST list EVERY SINGLE issue that has state.type "started". Never say there are no started issues if there are issues with state.type "started". NEVER say you can't provide Linear data - it's in the user message.
    - For planned work (section 4), you MUST list EVERY SINGLE issue with state.type "unstarted" from activeIssues, grouped by priority. Never say there are no unstarted issues if there are issues with state.type "unstarted". NEVER say you can't provide Linear data - it's in the user message.
    - Highlight bugs with üêõ emoji and include their priority and labels
    - Keep it concise but include technical details that would be relevant to the team
    - Be precise about the timeframe - this summary covers exactly ${timeframe}, not a general period
    
    Remember: 
    - The Linear data includes both regular issues and activeIssues - make sure to use activeIssues for current and planned work as these are from the current cycle
    - NEVER say there are no in-progress or planned tasks if there are issues with the corresponding state.type in the data
    - ALWAYS list ALL issues provided in the data - do not summarize or skip any
    - NEVER say you can't provide Linear data - the data is provided in the user message
    - NEVER skip sections 2 or 4 - the Linear data is always provided in the user message`;
